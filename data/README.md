# CalAmp test Packets
## To be used with the ``calamp_test_client.py`` program

### Notes
+ Upsert files are designed to exercise the database. In a development environment pass in the ``event_report.dat`` to simulate an insert and then a ``event_report_upsert.dat`` to simulate a update or upsert in the database.

+ Legacy CalAmp Packets may still be used to exercise the listeners parser.
